# Notes:Translation rules for “Pig Latin”: 
- “Pig Latin” is a fictitious language derived from English using a few simple rules.
- If a word starts with a vowel (a, A, e, E, i, I, o, O, u, U) then the translation is formed by adding a "way" to the end of the word. e.g. "at" becomes "atway", "egg" becomes "eggway"
- If a word contains no vowels (a, A, e, E, i, I, o, O, u, U) then the translation is formed by a adding a "way" to the end of word. e.g. "my" becomes "myway", "by" becomes "byway"
- If a word starts with a consonant and contains a vowel, the translation is formed by moving the consonant(s) up to the first vowel to the end of the word and adding an "ay". e.g. "bat" becomes "atbay", "that" becomes "atthay", "three" becomes "eethray"
- Words that start with an initial capital letter should be translated to words with an initial capital letter. e.g. "Houston" becomed "Oustonhay", "Iceland" becomes "Icelandway", "Marry" becomes "Arrymay"
